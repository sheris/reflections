##Diffing files
Input:
* diff -u oldFile newFile
Output:
Ignore the lines at the top of the file
- removed
+ added
####Reflections:
Using diff can speed up finding mistakes and just comparing files in general. Seems to be used well in critique and is incredibly useful there.
Being able to go back whenever you try something gives you the freedom to take chances and try new things without having to worry about losing what you've done already.

__Commit__: make one commit per logical change.

####Reflection:
I like the idea of committing and especially the idea of getting prompted to enter a comment. There is the downfall that you might forget to commit and get into a sticky or cumbersome situation.
